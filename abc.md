# What is Web Development?
Web development is the process of creating and maintaining websites and web applications. It involves independent works on -
 **Frontend Development:** User interface creation with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
 **Backend Development:** Management of the server, application, and database.
 **Full-Stack Development:** Both frontend and backend development tasks are handled.
The functionality, usability, and efficiency of websites are ensured through web development, which has become quite important for the visibility and functioning of any business.
# Client-Server Architecture
## Client
Its the web browser-like Chrome, Firefox-that:
- **Renders Content:** Shows HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Manages Interaction:** Collects the user inputs and submits to the server.
- **Local Storage:** Saves data locally for performance and offline use.
## Server
A powerful computer does;
- **Storage of data:** It does the handling of databases.
- **Business logic:** Does the server-side code.
- **Security:** Ensures the security of data and applications.
## Client-Server Interaction
HTTP protocol is used for:
1. **Request:** HTTP request made by the client.
2. **Processing:** Server processes the request.
3. **Response:** HTTP response made by the server.
4. **Rendering:** Content is rendered to the client.
This design is to enable webs in and around the network so that servers do the work, which is resource-intensive, with the client giving a user-friendly look.
# Frontend vs. Backend Development
## Frontend Development
It deals with the user interface and user experience of a website—directly connected to the user. This involves creating visual and interactive features that users will view and interact with in their web browser.
- **Technologies:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Tools:** Some of these are frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js.
- **Responsibilities:** Designing layout, implementing responsive design, handling user interactions
## Backend development
Backend development concerns the server side of a web application. It deals with the management of the server and database with application logic responsible for powering the frontend.
- **Technologies:** Python, Ruby, Java, Node.js
- **Frameworks:** Django, Flask, Express.js
- **Roles and Responsibilities:** Handling data storage/retrieval, user authentication, business logic, and server configuration.
## Full-Stack Development
Full-stack development involves the combination of frontend and backend development; a developer has the skills to handle the architecture of a web application at all levels. Thus, full-stack developers can handle everything from designing user interfaces to constructing server-side logic and databases.

## Creating Your First Web Application
Creating your very first web application with Django requires several steps:
refer to the documentation [click here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/intro/tutorial03/)
1. Start a New Project
Open your terminal and run:
```bash
django-admin startproject myproject
cd myproject
```
This will now create a directory structure as follows:
```
myproject/
├── manage.py
└── myproject/
├── __init__.py
       ├── asgi.py
       ├── settings.py
       ├── urls.py
       └── wsgi.py
   ```
2. Run the Server
 Run the development server:
```bash
   python manage.py runserver
```
3. Follow `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` in your web browser and you should get the Django default welcome page.
<div class="div-blue"> <span class="alert-header">Note:</span> <span class="alert-body">Starting a new Django project sets up the initial directory structure and configurations needed to begin development.
</span> </div>
## 3. Create an App
1. The following will create a new Django app called myapp.
   ```bash
   python manage.py startapp myapp
   ```
2. It will create the following directory structure:
```
   myapp/
   ├── __init__.py
   ├── admin.py
   ├── apps.py
   ├── migrations/
   │   └── __init__.py
   └── models.py
   ├── tests.py
   └── views.py 
```

<div class="div-blue"> <span class="alert-header">Note:</span> <span class="alert-body">Creating a new Django app modularizes your project, making it more manageable and scalable.</span> </div>

## Basic Structure
## I.Routes
1. Inside `myproject/urls.py`, add the routes for your project.

```python
   from django.contrib import admin
   from django.urls import path, include

   urlpatterns = [
      path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
      path('', include('myapp.urls')),
   ]
```
2. Open/create `myapp/urls.py`. 

```python
   from django.urls import path
   from. import views
   urlpatterns = [
  	
       path('', views.home, name='home'),
   ]
```
## II.Views

1. Create a simple view in `myapp/views.py`:

```python
   from django.http import HttpResponse
   def home(request):

         return HttpResponse("Hello, World!")
```
## III.Templates

1. Create a templates directory inside `myapp`, then add inside it an index.html file:
```
   myapp/
      ├── templates/
         └── index.html
```
2. Example `index.html`:

```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
   <head>
        <title>My First Django App</title>
   </head>
   <body>
       <h1>{{ message }}</h1>
   </body>
   </html>
```
3. Update the `home` view to use this template:
```python
   from django.shortcuts import render
   def home(request):

       context = {'message': 'hello This is my first Django Application'}
       return render(request, 'index.html', context)
```

![Output](https://github.com/anuja19103/Articles/assets/125860363/c0b6e837-d42e-4665-86f1-f6f985426d0c)
The steps above create a very basic Django web application with just one basic homepage view. Make this structure more sophisticated by adding more views, templates, and routes to get bigger applications.
# Understanding HTTP and URLs
## HTTP Protocol
HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol. It is the basis of communication on the web that allows for the transfer of data between clients, typically browsers, and servers, typically websites.
Some of its main components are:

- **Request:** This is sent by the client in order to request a resource from the server.
- **Response:** This is what is sent in reply by the server, carrying either the requested resource or the outcome of that request.
- **Methods:** define actions like GET or POST.
- **Status Codes:** define the result, like 200 OK or 404 Not Found.
- **Headers:** This is metadata for requests and responses. For example, Content-Type.
- **Body:** The actual data being sent, for example, HTML or JSON.
## URLs (Uniform Resource Locators)
A URL is an address by which web resources are accessed. It consists of a number of parts.
**Components of a URL**
1. **Scheme:** Protocol, for instance, `http` or `https`.
2. **Host:** Domain name or IP address, say, `www.example.com`.
3. **Port:** Optional, port number, for example`:80` or `:443`.
4. **Path:** Particular resource, such as `/about`.
5. **Query:** Optional: Parameters of the resource, such as `?id=123`.
6. **Fragment:** Optional, which part of the resource, like `#section2`.
For instance, an URL could look as follows: `https://www.example.com:8080/path/to/resource?query=value#fragment`
## HTTP Methods and Status Codes
HTTP methods define an intent to do action on a resource:
- **GET :** to retrieve data from an origin server.
- **POST :** to submit data.
- **PUT :** to replace resource.
- **DELETE :** to remove data.
- **PATCH :**  to modify data.
- **HEAD :** to retrieve header only.
## Handling in Python (Django Example)
1. Create a Django project and app:

```bash
   django-admin startproject myproject
   cd myproject
   python manage.py startapp myapp
```
2. Define a view in `myapp/views.py`:

```python
   from django.http import HttpResponse

   def hello_world(request):
       return HttpResponse("Hello, World!")
```
3. Configure URL routing in `myproject/urls.py`:
```python
   from django.contrib import admin
   from django.urls import path

   from myapp.views import hello_world

   urlpatterns = [

       path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
       path('hello/', hello_world),
   ]
```
4. Now run the development server:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
5. Access the view in a browser: Open a browser and type the URL `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. 

Below is the output.
![Output - portno](https://github.com/anuja19103/Articles/assets/125860363/833b324e-56f8-4942-a9de-125f2030d0f0)


# Templating and Rendering
## Templating Engines
**What are Templating Engines?**
- Templating engine should be able to process the template files within the application.
- The engine replaces variables in a template file with actual values that are passed by the application through
```
from django.shortcuts import render
def hello_name(request, name):

    return render(request, 'template.html', {'name': name})
```
It will render `template.html` and replace `{{name}}` with the given `name`. It works as dynamic html output.
## Advantages Of Templating Engines -
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Allows us to separate the presentation from the business logic.
2. **Code Reusability:** Reduces DRY violation and code duplication by providing reusability of HTML structure in multipe pages.
 3. **Dynamic Content:** It is easy to generate dynamic content in templates.
# Working with Databases
## Role of Databases
Databases are one of the fundamental building blocks peripheral to web development. They store, organize, and retrieve data in a safe and efficient fashion. Be it management of user accounts, transactions processing, or storing content data—databases make sure that your data is accessible and manageable. 

## Interacting with Databases
Interacting with a database in web applications can be carried out by frameworks such as Django. Django operates through a compelling feature known as Object-Relational Mapping, conducting easier database operations. That is, the ORM will act as the bridge between a web application and a database. A developer is thus able to interact with the database using Python instead of writing complex SQL queries. This leads to the fastest development, readability, and maintainability of code.
## Understanding ORM
Object-Relational Mapping is a programming technique used for converting data between incompatible type systems in languages that use Object-oriented programming. It provides an interface that allows access between the web application and the database, thus being middleware, it enables manipulation of the database using high-level programming constructs.
## Example in Django
In Django, models are used to represent database tables, where every attribute corresponds to a column in the table. For example:
```python
   from django.db import models
   class Person(models.Model):
      name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
      age = models.IntegerField()
```
# Deployment and Hosting
## The Process of Deployment
Basically, deploying a web application involves some critical steps for the smooth and effective running of your application within a production environment. It starts by preparing your code through testing, optimization, then finally packaging your application. You then need to decide on a hosting service that best suits your requirements.  Finally, set up a server for running your application.
## Web Hosting Services
Among the plethora of choices, each web host service has its special features and plans. Heroku provides ease of use and simplicity from which beginners and small projects can add value to these qualities. AWS is destined to offer a wide variety of services and scalability options suitable for small and large-scale applications. 
## Choosing the Right Service for Hosting
Choosing the correct form of hosting service for your web application is an administrative decision that impacts the performance and users' experience with your application. In choosing a hosting service, there are various factors to be put into consideration, including: 
- **Scalability**
- **Reliability**
- **Performance**
- **Security**
- **Cost**
